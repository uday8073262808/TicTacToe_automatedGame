# TicTacToe_automatedGame
The project is based on the popular game “TIC TAC TOE” also known commonly called as “X’s and O’s” or “noughts and crosses”. There is 3X3 board on which the user plays against the computer. Hence it is only a single player game.
X and Os are placed tactically to get three of the same symbols either in a row or in a column or even diagonally. If so done, then we have a winner.
The player tries to block the computer from getting 3 in a row and vice versa.
There is also a possibility of a tie occurring wherein neither computer nor the
player wins the game.
